          <p>    Here's what one of our fellow travellers had to say about traveling to India: <br>
                  " I'm so grateful for Traveller's Guide for helping me seek the perfect travel destination. I was able to immerse myself into India's rich culture by
                  staying at a hostel, and interacting with Indian people themselves. I saw a cooking demonstration inside a family's home and had dinner with them. This
                  one of kind experience is one that I will remember forever. " </P>
